To configure multiple Bolt `Driver` connections you need to use the `grails.neo4j.connections` setting. For example in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails:
    neo4j:
        url: bolt://localhost:7687
        connections:
            moreBooks:
                url: bolt://localhost:7688
            evenMoreBooks:
                url: bolt://localhost:7689
----

You can configure individual settings for each Bolt driver. If a setting is not specified by default the setting is inherited from the default Neo4j driver.
