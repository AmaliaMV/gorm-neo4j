You can switch to a different connection at runtime with the `withConnection` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.withConnection("moreBooks") {
    list()
}
----

NOTE: The call to `list()` should not be prefixed with `Book.` as this will use the default connection

Any logic executed within the body of the closure will use the alternate connection. Once the close finishes execution GORM will switch back to the default connection automatically.
