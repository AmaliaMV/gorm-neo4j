You will have noticed from the previous example that the relationship type is `CASTMEMBER`.

By default GORM uses the class name for the relationship type. You can configure an alternative default using the `mapping` block if necessary:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.neo4j.*
import static grails.neo4j.mapping.MappingBuilder.*

static mapping = relationship {
   type "ACTED_IN"
   direction Direction.OUTGOING
}
----

The above example also demonstrates configuring the `direction` of the relationship.

You can also assign a per instance relationship type overriding the default:

[source,groovy]
----
def castMember = new CastMember(
    type: "DIRECTED"
    from: new Person(name: "Lana Wachowski"),
    to: new Movie(title: "The Matrix"))
    .save(flush:true)
----

And then later use the type in queries:

[source,groovy]
----
List<CastMember> directors = CastMember.findAllByType("DIRECTED")
----
