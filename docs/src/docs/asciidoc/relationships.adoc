In addition to being able to map a domain class to a Neo4j `Node`, since 6.1 you are able to map a domain class to a Neo4j `Relationship`.

For example consider the following domain model:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.neo4j.*

class Movie {
    String title
    static hasMany = [cast:CastMember]
}

class CastMember implements Relationship<Person, Movie> {
    List<String> roles = []
}

class Person {
    String name
    static hasMany = [appearances:CastMember]
}
----

The `CastMember` class implements the link:../api/grails/neo4j/Relationship.html[Relationship] trait which takes two generic arguments: The class that represents the start of the relationship and the class that represents the end.

You can then use regular GORM methods to query the `CastMember` relationship. In addition because Neo4j relationships are dynamic you can assign additional properties to them at runtime. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def castMember = new CastMember(
    from: new Person(name: "Keanu"),
    to: new Movie(title: "The Matrix"),
    roles: ["Neo"])

castMember['realName'] = "Thomas Anderson"
castMember.save(flush:true)
----

In the above example the `roles` property is saved as a property of the relationship, as is the dynamic `realName` property.

You can then query relationships using these properties:

[source,groovy]
----
CastMember cm = CastMember.findByRoles(['Neo'])
Person person = cm.from
println person.name
----

The above example will produce a Cypher query that queries the relationship rather than the nodes:

----
MATCH (n:Celeb)-[r]->(to:Movie) WHERE ( r.roles={1} ) RETURN r as rel, n as from, to as to
 ] for params [[1:[Neo]]
