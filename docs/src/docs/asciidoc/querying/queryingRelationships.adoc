In addition to being able to query for paths since 6.1, GORM for Neo4j features support for Neo4j relationship queries. For example given the following class:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/domain/Person.groovy[tags=class,indent=0]
----

You can find a relationship between two entities with the following query:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/RelationshipSpec.groovy[tags=findRelationship,indent=0]
----

The arguments can be retrieved instances or unloaded proxies to nodes.

TIP: Querying for relationships in this way is not as flexible as using relationship entities. Consider <<relationships,mapping an entity to a relationship>>.


You can also find all the relationships between two entities:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/RelationshipSpec.groovy[tags=findRelationships,indent=0]
----

Or find all the relationships between two entity types:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/RelationshipSpec.groovy[tags=findRelationshipsForTypes,indent=0]
----
