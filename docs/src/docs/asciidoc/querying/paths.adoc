Since 6.1, GORM for Neo4j features support for Neo4j path queries. For example given the following class:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/domain/Person.groovy[tags=class,indent=0]
----

And the following setup data:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/PathSpec.groovy[tags=model,indent=0]
----

Which creates a friend graph it is possible to find out the shortest path from one friend to another with the `findShortestPath` method which returns a `grails.neo4j.Path` instance:


[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/PathSpec.groovy[tags=shortestPath,indent=0]
----

You can also find the shortest path without first loading the entities using proxies:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/PathSpec.groovy[tags=shortestPathProxy,indent=0]
----

Finally it is also possible to use Cypher queries to find a path:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsdir}/grails/gorm/tests/path/PathSpec.groovy[tags=pathCypher,indent=0]
