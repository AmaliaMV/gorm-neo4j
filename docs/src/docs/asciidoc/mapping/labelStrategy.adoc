The default strategy for defining labels is to use the class name, however the strategy to define labels for a given node is completely configurable. For example you can use static mapping to define you labels:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    static mapping = {
        labels "Person", "People"
    }
}
----

You can also define labels dynamically. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    static mapping = {
        labels { GraphPersistentEntity pe -> "`${pe.javaClass.name}`" }
    }
}
----

WARNING: Dynamic labels have a negative impact on write performance as GORM is unable to batch operations with dynamic labels so should be used sparingly.

Or mix static and dynamic labels:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    labels "People", { GraphPersistentEntity pe -> "`${pe.javaClass.name}`" }
}
----

At the cost of read/write performance you can define dynamic labels based on an instance:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    labels { GraphPersistentEntity pe, instance ->  // 2 arguments: instance dependent label
        "`${instance.profession}`"
    }
}
