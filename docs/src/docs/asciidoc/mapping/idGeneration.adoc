GORM by default uses a native Neo4j node identifiers for each `id` property of a domain class.
These have a couple of disadvantages that should encourage you to use an alternative id generation strategy:

1. Neo4j node ids are more like internal identifiers used by Neo4j to identify nodes (equivalent to the `rowid` in a SQL database), but can be potentially re-used if data is deleted and recreated. This makes them not appropriate for use as a public facing key.
2. In order to obtain a Node id GORM must perform an insert (similar to the way GORM for Hibernate has to perform a SQL INSERT if the id generation strategy is an auto-increment column), which means it cannot efficiently batch up Cypher `CREATE` statements.

This last disadvantage can be worked around by using the `saveAll` method to save multiple domain classes at once:

[source,groovy]
----
Club.saveAll([
    new Club(name:"Manchester United"),
    new Club(name:"Arsenal")
])
----

However, it is generally better to consider a different id generation strategy. The recommended approach is to use `assigned` identifiers that relate to your domain. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
import static grails.neo4j.mapping.MappingBuilder.*
class Club {
    String name
    ...
    static mapping = node {
        id {
            generator "assigned"
            name "name"
        }
    }

}
----


Another option is a custom identity generator based on the Snowflake algorithm and stores the generated identifier in a property of each Neo4j node called `__id__`:

[source,groovy]
----
import static grails.neo4j.mapping.MappingBuilder.*
class Club {
    String name
    ...
    static mapping = node {
        id {
            generator "snowflake"
        }
    }

}
----

If you wish to globally change id generation then you can do so in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` (`Config.groovy` in Grails 2.x):


[source,groovy]
----
grails.neo4j.default.mapping = {
    id generator:'assigned'
}
----

In addition, if you wish to use a custom identity generation strategy you can do so by specifying a class name that implements the `IdGenerator` interface:

[source,groovy]
----
grails.neo4j.default.mapping = {
    id generator:'com.foo.MyIdGenerator'
}
----
